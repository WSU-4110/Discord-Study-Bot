# StudyBot Usage Guide

## <b>How to start using Discord</b></br>
Start by making a Discord account at https://discord.com with a **verified email** and creating a server using Discord's beginner guide. From there, you can invite the bot to your server.

## <b>How to start using the bot</b></br>
To use the bot, visit the [invitation link](https://dylude.xyz/Discord/) and allow the bot to join a server of your choice, in which you are an administrator. From there, use the `init` command to begin using StudyBot's features! View the README and use the `help` command to learn the bot's tools.

## <b>How to run your own instance of the bot</b></br>
To host the bot yourself separate from the main developers, simply clone this repository. In the project directory, run `pip install .` to execute the `setup.py` file and install all the required dependencies.<br><br>
<i>Note: It is up to you to create your own bot using Discord's Developer Portal. A guide to how you can do that can be found [here](https://discordia.me/en/developer-mode). Additionally, setting up your own environment variables and database with the required tables is up to you.</i>
